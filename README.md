## 1. Project Planning & Management

### A. Overview
In a soda bottling production line, there have been a few issues resulting in decreased efficiency and output over a span of five days. The documented data includes information on operators, products, start and end times, and downtime factors for each batch.

This project thoroughly analyzes the data to uncover critical insights that can help remediate and alleviate inefficiencies in the manufacturerâ€™s production process.

#### Objectives:
- Build a data model.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Determine and answer analysis questions.
- Develop forecasting questions and predict future downtime.
- Create a visualization dashboard.
- Prepare a final report and presentation.

#### Scope:
The scope of the project includes:
- Analyzing data from the production line.
- Identifying key factors contributing to downtime.
- Developing predictive models to forecast downtime.
- Creating visualizations to present findings to stakeholders.
- Providing actionable insights to improve production efficiency.
